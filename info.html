		<p>If you are concerned that someone you know might be struggling with an eating disorder, the first step is to talk to them about it. The goal of an introductory conversation like this is simply to open up a dialogue and let them know that you are there for support.</p>
		<h6>Things to keep in mind:</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>You can't "save" anyone</li>
			<li>The person is more than their disease and should be treated accordingly. Nobody wants to be treated like an invalid or an object of pity.</li>
			<li>Understand that the person may not be ready to face their problem, and forcing them to before they are ready would be nearly impossible and probably not helpful. Ultimately getting help for an ED is the responsibility of the affected individual, something they will benefit from only when they are truly ready. However, by bringing up your concern you may have planted the seed that will one day lead them to get help they need.</li>
			<li>If the situation is one where you become concerned for the person’s safety, or is accompanied by suicidal thoughts or behavior, seek the help of a professional.</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>Before:</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Make a plan to approach the person in a private place where there is no immediate stress and time to talk.</li>
			<li>In some cases it is better to start with a general conversation of how they are doing and then work your way around to your concerns.</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>During:</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Give the person time to talk and encourage them to verbalize their feelings. Accept what they say non-judgmentally.</li>
			<li>It is okay to questions if you have them.</li>
			<li>Avoid “you” statements and instead use “I” statements.  Instead of saying “you need to eat,” “you are being unhealthy,” “you are acting irresponsibly.” Instead, say things like, “I am concerned when I see you repeatedly skipping meals,” or “I worry about how little you eat.”</li>
			<li>Avoid simple solutions such as, “If you would just stop it would all be fine.”</li>
			<li>Avoid comments on appearance or weight. These will likely backfire and be seen as either a lie or a positive reinforcement for their behavior.</li>
			<li>Don’t argue about whether they do or do not have a problem. Power struggles are not helpful. Try saying something like, “I hear what you are saying and I hope you are right that this is not a problem. But I am still worried about what I have seen and heard, and that is not going to go away.”</li>
			<li>It is possible that the person will become angry, deny the problem, or refuse to look into treatment. This is often part of the illness, and in any case, they have a right to refuse treatment (unless their life is in danger). In cases like this, try saying something like, “I know you may not want to deal with this right now, but that will not stop me from worrying about you or caring about you. I may bring this up again to you later, and maybe we could talk more about it then.”</li>
			<li>Provide information about resources for treatment, offer to go with the person to see a counselor, physician, or nutritionist.</li>
			<li>Sometimes suggesting a nutritionist is most effective as it seems least invasive and may mesh well with someone’s commitment to “health.”</li>
			<li>It can also help to ask them to consider going for one appointment before they make a decision about ongoing treatment.</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>After:</h6>
			<ul>
			<li>If your friend isn't ready to respond that's okay, but if you're worried it's life-threatening make sure you talk to a professional.</li>
			<li>If you promised to follow up with the discussion later or go with them to a treatment-related appointment, make sure you do so.</li>
			<li>Again, remember that the person is more than their disease. Make sure to maintain your friendship outside of discussions about the ED. (In other words, don’t let the disorder become the only thing you talk about.)</li>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">What is Intuitive Eating?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
		<p>Intuitive Eating is a nutrition philosophy, not a diet plan. It rests on the principle that if you really get in touch with your own body and mind, you will eat healthy food naturally and without any particular effort. The basic summary is, “Eat when you’re hungry, stop when you’re full.” It encourages getting in touch with your body so that you can tell when you are truly hungry and truly full versus eating or restricting as a way to avoid dealing with another emotion. Intuitive eating has no “diet rules,” “forbidden foods,” or calorie counting, and the ultimate goal is not to achieve any particular body size or shape, but rather to be healthy.</p>

		<p>The principles (from <a href="www.intuitiveeating.org">IntuitiveEating.org</a>):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Reject the Diet Mentality.</span> Throw out the diet books and magazine articles that offer you false hope of losing weight quickly, easily, and permanently. Get angry at the lies that have led you to feel as if you were a failure when diets didn't work.</li>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Honor Your Hunger.</span> Keep your body biologically fed with adequate energy and carbohydrates. Learning to honor this first biological signal sets the stage for re-building trust with yourself and food.
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Make Peace with Food.</span> Call a truce, stop the food fight! Give yourself unconditional permission to eat.</li>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Challenge the Food Police.</span> Scream a loud "NO" to thoughts in your head that declare you're "good" for eating a certain number of calories or "bad" because you ate a "forbidden" food. The Food Police monitor the unreasonable rules that dieting has created.</li>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Respect Your Fullness.</span> Listen for the body signals that tell you that you are no longer hungry. Observe the signs that show that you're comfortably full. Pause in the middle of a meal or food and ask yourself how the food tastes, and what is your current fullness level?</li>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Discover the Satisfaction Factor.</span> In our fury to be thin, we often overlook one of the most basic gifts of existence--the pleasure and satisfaction that can be found in the eating experience. When you eat what you really want, in an environment that is inviting and conducive, the pleasure you derive will be a powerful force in helping you feel satisfied and content.</li>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Honor Your Feelings Without Using Food.</span> Find ways to comfort, nurture, and resolve your issues without using food. Anxiety, loneliness, boredom, anger are emotions we all experience throughout life. Food won't fix any of these feelings.</li>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Respect Your Body.</span> Accept your genetic blueprint. Respect your body, so you can feel better about who you are. It's hard to reject the diet mentality if you are unrealistic and overly critical about your body shape.</li>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Exercise--Feel the Difference.</span> Forget militant exercise. Shift your focus to how it feels to move your body, such as energizing, rather than the calorie burning effect of exercise.</li>
			<li><span class="bullet-title">Honor Your Health with Gentle Nutrition.</span> Make food choices that honor your health and taste-buds while making you feel well. Remember that you don't have to eat a “perfect” diet to be healthy. You will not suddenly get a nutrient deficiency from the occasional dessert.”</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Intuitive eating requires being very in touch with your body's natural hunger/fullness signals, which is not possible for everyone at all times. For example, some people who are in recovery from eating disorders have found that their bodies' natural signals are no longer functioning as they should due to the disorder, and therefore need to use other strategies to stay healthy. Nevertheless, intuitive eating can be a very helpful mindset for people who might be struggling to find a peaceful relationship with their body and with food.</p>

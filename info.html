        <h5>What are eating disorders?</h5>
          <p>Eating disorders are serious, life-threatening illnesses - not choices. People with eating disorders suffer from disturbances in their relationship to food and their patterns of eating. They may also struggle with self-image and their perceptions of their own body (body dysmorphia).</p>
        <h5>How common are eating disorders?</h5>
          <p>Eating disorders are on the rise in the United States and worldwide. Among U.S. females in their teens and 20s, the prevalence of clinical and subclinical anorexia may be as high as 15%. 10% of reported eating disorder cases are among men, although researchers believe the true number is much higher due to severe under-reporting.</p>
        <h5>Who gets eating disorders?</h5>
          <p>Anyone can get an eating disorder, regardless of age, race, sex, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other factor. See our information on <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#info-modal8">EDs and Body Image in Diverse Communities</a> for more.</p>
        <h5>How serious are eating disorders?</h5>
          <p>Unfortunately, eating disorders are often life-threatening, and can lead to a host of serious health complications in the heart, bones, stomach, asophagus, teeth, and endocrine systems. Anorexia nervosa also has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.
        <h5>What causes eating disorders?</h5>
          <p>The causes of eating disorders are complex and typically include socio economic, environmental, cultural, and biologic factors. Eating disorders are often symptomatic of deeper psychological issues such as low self-esteem and the desire to feel in control; however, a significant genetic component is believed to be involved.

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
		<p>If you are concerned that someone you know might be struggling with an eating disorder, the first step is to talk to them about it. The goal of an introductory conversation like this is simply to open up a dialogue and let them know that you are there for support.</p>
		<h5>Things to keep in mind:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>You can't "save" anyone</li>
			<li>The person is more than their disease and should be treated accordingly. Nobody wants to be treated like an invalid or an object of pity.</li>
			<li>Understand that the person may not be ready to face their problem, and forcing them to before they are ready would be nearly impossible and probably not helpful. Ultimately getting help for an ED is the responsibility of the affected individual, something they will benefit from only when they are truly ready. However, by bringing up your concern you may have planted the seed that will one day lead them to get help they need.</li>
			<li>If the situation is one where you become concerned for the person’s safety, or is accompanied by suicidal thoughts or behavior, seek the help of a professional.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Before:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Make a plan to approach the person in a private place where there is no immediate stress and time to talk.</li>
			<li>In some cases it is better to start with a general conversation of how they are doing and then work your way around to your concerns.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>During:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Give the person time to talk and encourage them to verbalize their feelings. Accept what they say non-judgmentally.</li>
			<li>It is okay to questions if you have them.</li>
			<li>Avoid “you” statements and instead use “I” statements.  Instead of saying “you need to eat,” “you are being unhealthy,” “you are acting irresponsibly.” Instead, say things like, “I am concerned when I see you repeatedly skipping meals,” or “I worry about how little you eat.”</li>
			<li>Avoid simple solutions such as, “If you would just stop it would all be fine.”</li>
			<li>Avoid comments on appearance or weight. These will likely backfire and be seen as either a lie or a positive reinforcement for their behavior.</li>
			<li>Don’t argue about whether they do or do not have a problem. Power struggles are not helpful. Try saying something like, “I hear what you are saying and I hope you are right that this is not a problem. But I am still worried about what I have seen and heard, and that is not going to go away.”</li>
			<li>It is possible that the person will become angry, deny the problem, or refuse to look into treatment. This is often part of the illness, and in any case, they have a right to refuse treatment (unless their life is in danger). In cases like this, try saying something like, “I know you may not want to deal with this right now, but that will not stop me from worrying about you or caring about you. I may bring this up again to you later, and maybe we could talk more about it then.”</li>
			<li>Provide information about resources for treatment, offer to go with the person to see a counselor, physician, or nutritionist.</li>
			<li>Sometimes suggesting a nutritionist is most effective as it seems least invasive and may mesh well with someone’s commitment to “health.”</li>
			<li>It can also help to ask them to consider going for one appointment before they make a decision about ongoing treatment.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>After:</h5>
			<ul>
			<li>If your friend isn't ready to respond that's okay, but if you're worried it's life-threatening make sure you talk to a professional.</li>
			<li>If you promised to follow up with the discussion later or go with them to a treatment-related appointment, make sure you do so.</li>
			<li>Again, remember that the person is more than their disease. Make sure to maintain your friendship outside of discussions about the ED. (In other words, don’t let the disorder become the only thing you talk about.)</li>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">What is Intuitive Eating?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
		<p>Intuitive Eating is a nutrition philosophy, not a diet plan. It rests on the principle that if you really get in touch with your own body and mind, you will eat healthy food naturally and without any particular effort. The basic summary is, “Eat when you’re hungry, stop when you’re full.” It encourages getting in touch with your body so that you can tell when you are truly hungry and truly full versus eating or restricting as a way to avoid dealing with another emotion. Intuitive eating has no “diet rules,” “forbidden foods,” or calorie counting, and the ultimate goal is not to achieve any particular body size or shape, but rather to be healthy.</p>

		<p>The principles (from <a href="www.intuitiveeating.org">IntuitiveEating.org</a>):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="bold">Reject the Diet Mentality.</span> Throw out the diet books and magazine articles that offer you false hope of losing weight quickly, easily, and permanently. Get angry at the lies that have led you to feel as if you were a failure when diets didn't work.</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Honor Your Hunger.</span> Keep your body biologically fed with adequate energy and carbohydrates. Learning to honor this first biological signal sets the stage for re-building trust with yourself and food.
			<li><span class="bold">Make Peace with Food.</span> Call a truce, stop the food fight! Give yourself unconditional permission to eat.</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Challenge the Food Police.</span> Scream a loud "NO" to thoughts in your head that declare you're "good" for eating a certain number of calories or "bad" because you ate a "forbidden" food. The Food Police monitor the unreasonable rules that dieting has created.</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Respect Your Fullness.</span> Listen for the body signals that tell you that you are no longer hungry. Observe the signs that show that you're comfortably full. Pause in the middle of a meal or food and ask yourself how the food tastes, and what is your current fullness level?</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Discover the Satisfaction Factor.</span> In our fury to be thin, we often overlook one of the most basic gifts of existence--the pleasure and satisfaction that can be found in the eating experience. When you eat what you really want, in an environment that is inviting and conducive, the pleasure you derive will be a powerful force in helping you feel satisfied and content.</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Honor Your Feelings Without Using Food.</span> Find ways to comfort, nurture, and resolve your issues without using food. Anxiety, loneliness, boredom, anger are emotions we all experience throughout life. Food won't fix any of these feelings.</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Respect Your Body.</span> Accept your genetic blueprint. Respect your body, so you can feel better about who you are. It's hard to reject the diet mentality if you are unrealistic and overly critical about your body shape.</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Exercise--Feel the Difference.</span> Forget militant exercise. Shift your focus to how it feels to move your body, such as energizing, rather than the calorie burning effect of exercise.</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Honor Your Health with Gentle Nutrition.</span> Make food choices that honor your health and taste-buds while making you feel well. Remember that you don't have to eat a “perfect” diet to be healthy. You will not suddenly get a nutrient deficiency from the occasional dessert.”</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Intuitive eating requires being very in touch with your body's natural hunger/fullness signals, which is not possible for everyone at all times. For example, some people who are in recovery from eating disorders have found that their bodies' natural signals are no longer functioning as they should due to the disorder, and therefore need to use other strategies to stay healthy. Nevertheless, intuitive eating can be a very helpful mindset for people who might be struggling to find a peaceful relationship with their body and with food.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <h5>What is body image?</h5>
          <p>Body image is the perception that a person has of their physical self, but more importantly the thoughts and feelings the person experiences as a result of that perception. It is important to understand that these feelings can be positive, negative or a combination of both and are influenced by individual and environmental factors.</p>
        <h5>Why is positive body image important?</h5>
          <p>People with positive body image will generally have a higher level of physical and psychological health, and better personal development. A positive body image will affect levels of self-esteemm and self-acceptance, and foster healthier life outlook and behaviors.</p>
        <h5>Tips to improve body image</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Focus on your positive qualities, skills and talents - this can help you learn to accept and appreciate your whole self. A person is much more than just a physical being.</li>
            <li>Say positive things to yourself every day - when you say something often enough you start to believe it.</li>
            <li>Avoid self talk that is berating or negative.</li>
            <li>Focus on what your body can do and has done - the body is amazing; appreciating and respecting all the things it can do will help you to feel more positively about it.</li>
            <li>Set positive, health related focused goals rather than weight loss related ones - engaging in practices with food and exercise that promote health over weight loss/management is more positive for your overall wellbeing. Remember that external appearance is NOT an indicator of physical health.</li>
            <li>Avoid making body comparisons to others - everyone is unique and differences are what makes a person special. Admiring the beauty in others can be positive for your own body confidence but it is important that you appreciate the beauty and accept yourself as a whole in order to feel more comfortable in your skin.</li>
            <li>Make a conscious decision about what to read and look at - remember that the majority of images presented in the media are unrealistic and represent a minority of the population. Many of the images in magazines have been digitally altered and do not represent what real people look like.</li>

          </ul>
        <h5>Body image is influenced by the media.</h5>
          <p>The way the media represents "ideal" bodies, particularly women's bodies, is unrealistic and harmful.</p>
          <img src="body image3.png" class="img-responsive">
        <h5>However, negative body image and poor media representation do NOT "cause" eating disorders. See our information on <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#info-modal9">The Relationship between Body Image and EDs</a> for more.</h5>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Redirecting Body Negativity</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>Most of us see and hear problematic comments about others' bodies constantly in our everyday lives. It might make you uncomfortable, but how do you react when you see a comment on your friend's profile picture about how "hot and skinny" her new dress makes her look? What do you say when you hear one friend tease another about being too skinny and needing to "bulk up"?</p>
        <h5>Tips to foster body positivity</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">DON'T:</span> make comments about other people's bodies, even positive ones. It seems nice to compliment someone by calling them "skinny," but comments like this tend to reinforce the idea that "skinny" is always the ideal shape to be. If that person is secretly struggling with an eating disorder, telling them they are "skinny" like it's the best thing in the world is only likely to reinforce their negative thought patterns.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">DO:</span> compliment the whole person. Telling someone that they look happy, glowing, brilliant, fierce, strong, free, or confident is a way of complimenting someone without bringing in harmful and unrealistic appearance ideals.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">DON'T:</span> compare yourself to others or compete to be the most self-deprecating. When someone says something negative about their appearance, don't respond with something negative about YOUR appearance to try to make them feel better. Comparing bodies is always a lose-lose situation.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">DO:</span> focus on the positive. Try to redirect conversations to the things that bodies can do, or to the aspects of a person's life that are more important than appearances.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">DON'T:</span> talk over someone who tries to tell you about their negative body image. Shutting them down by insisting "don't say that!" or "you look fine!" will not help them overcome whatever issues they are having.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">DO:</span> take the time to listen, if you can. If someone consistently mentions body shame or guilt around eating or exercise, it might be a sign that something else is going on with them.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">DON'T:</span> be too hard on yourself. Body love is a process; no one is going to be good at it all the time.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">DO:</span> talk about it. If you catch yourself having a lot of body-negative thoughts, talk to someone about it. We all live in an appearance-obsessed society, so it's likely other people feel the same way you do. Try teaming up with a friend to support each other when you're having a hard time.</li>
          </ul>
        <h5>"Which dress should I wear out tonight? I haven't gone to the gym in like a week, I feel so fat."</h5>
        <p>Negative response:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Please, I weigh so much more than you, you have nothing to worry about."</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Positive response:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Wear whatever you'll be more comfortable in! You're going to have way more fun if you feel good in what you're wearing."</li>
          </ul>
        <h5>Your friend changes his profile picture to a shot of him at the beach in his swim trunks.</h5>
        <p>Negative comment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Hottie with a body!!!"</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Positive comment:</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Eating Disorder Myths</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <h5>Eating disorders are not an illness</h5>
          <p>Eating disorders are a complex medical/psychiatric illness. Eating disorders are classified as a mental illness in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-IV), are considered to often have a biologic basis, and co-occur with other mental illness such as major depression, anxiety, or obsessivecompulsive disorder.</p>
        <h5>Eating disorders are a choice</h5>
          <p>People do not choose to have eating disorders. They develop over time and require appropriate treatment to address the complex medical/psychiatric symptoms and underlying issues.</p>
        <h5>Anorexia nervosa is the only serious eating disorder</h5>
          <p>All eating disorders can have damaging physical and psychological consequences. Although excess weight loss is a feature of anorexia nervosa, effects of other eating disorders can also be serious or life threatening, such as the electrolyte imbalance associated with purging.</p>
        <h5>A person cannot die from bulimia</h5>
          <p>While the rate of death from bulimia nervosa is much lower than that seen with anorexia nervosa, a person with bulimia can be at high risk for death and sudden death because of purging and its impact on the heart and electrolyte imbalances. Laxative use and excessive exercise can increase risk of death in individuals who are actively bulimic.</p>
        <h5>Subclinical eating disorders are not serious</h5>
          <p>Although a person may not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, the consequences associated with disordered eating (e.g., frequent vomiting, excessive exercise, anxiety) can have longterm consequences and requires intervention. Early intervention may also prevent progression to a fullblown clinical eating disorder.</p>
        <h5>Dieting is normal adolescent behavior</h5>
          <p>While fad dieting or body image concerns have become “normal” features of adolescent life in Western cultures, dieting or frequent and/or extreme dieting can be a risk factor for developing an eating disorder. It is especially a risk factor for young people with family histories of eating disorders and depression, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. A focus on health, wellbeing, and healthy body image and acceptance is preferable. Any dieting should be monitored.</p>
        <h5>Anorexia is “dieting gone bad”</h5>
          <p>Anorexia has nothing to do with dieting. It is a lifethreatening medical/psychiatric disorder.</p>
        <h5>You can tell if a person has an eating disorder simply by appearance</h5>
          <p>You can’t. Anorexia may be easier to detect visually, although individuals may wear loose clothing to conceal their body. Bulimia is harder to “see” because individuals often have normal weight or may even be overweight. Some people may have obvious signs, such as sudden weight loss or gain; others may not. People with an eating disorder can become very effective at hiding the signs and symptoms. Thus, eating disorders can be undetected for months, years, or a lifetime.</p>
        <h5>Eating disorders are about appearance and beauty</h5>
          <p>Eating disorders are a mental illness and have little to do with food, eating, appearance, or beauty. This is indicated by the continuation of the illness long after a person has reached his or her initial ‘target’ weight. Eating disorders are usually related to emotional issues such as control and low self-esteem and often exist as part of a “dual” diagnosis of major depression, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
        <h5>Eating disorders are caused by unhealthy and unrealistic images in the media</h5>
          <p>While sociocultural factors (such as the ‘thin ideal’) can contribute or trigger development of eating disorders, research has shown that the causes are multifactorial and include biologic, social, and environmental contributors. Not everyone who is exposed to media images of thin “ideal” body images develops an eating disorder. Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa have been documented in the medical literature since the 1800s, when social concepts of an ideal body shape for women and men differed significantly from today—long before mass media promoted thin body images for women or lean muscular body images for men.</p>
        <h5>Recovery from eating disorders is rare</h5>
          <p>Recovery can take months or years, but many people eventually recover after treatment. Recovery rates vary widely among individuals and the different eating disorders. Early intervention with appropriate care can improve the outcome regardless of the eating disorder. Although anorexia nervosa is associated with the highest death rate of all psychiatric disorders, research suggests that about half of people with anorexia nervosa recover, about 20% continue to experience issues with food, and about 20% die in the longer term due to medical or psychological complications.</p>
        <h5>Eating disorders are an attempt to seek attention</h5>
          <p>The causes of eating disorders are complex and typically include socio economic, environmental, cultural, and biologic factors. People who experience eating disorders often go to great lengths to conceal it due to feelings of shame or a desire to persist in behavior perceived to afford the sufferer control in life. Eating disorders are often symptomatic of deeper psychological issues such as low self-esteem and the desire to feel in control. The behaviors associated with eating disorders may sometimes be interpreted as ‘attention seeking”; however, they indicate that the affected person has very serious struggles and needs help.</p>
        <h5>Kids under age 15 are too young to have an eating disorder</h5>
          <p>Eating disorders have been diagnosed in children as young as seven or eight years of age. Often the precursor behaviors are not recognized until middle to late teens. The average age at onset for anorexia nervosa is 17 years; the disorder rarely begins before puberty. Bulimia nervosa is usually diagnosed in mid-to-late teens or early 20s, although some people do not seek treatment until even later in life (30s or 40s).</p>
        <h5>You can’t suffer from more than one eating disorder</h5>
          <p>Individuals often suffer from more than one eating disorder at a time. Bulimarexia is a term that was coined to describe individuals who go back and forth between bulimia and anorexia. Bulimia and anorexia can occur independently of each other, although about half of all anorexics become bulimic.</p>
        <h5>Achieving normal weight means the anorexia is cured</h5>
          <p>Weight recovery is essential to enabling a person with anorexia to participate meaningfully in further treatment, such as psychological therapy. Recovering to normal weight does not in and of itself signify a cure, because eating disorders are complex medical/psychiatric illnesses.</p>

        <h5>Men</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>About 10% of reported ED cases are in men, but researchers believe the actual number is much higher (severe under-reporting)</li>
            <li>There is a clinical consensus that EDs in males are very similar to, if not indistinguishable from, EDs in women</li>
            <li>Women and girls tend to be more focused on losing weight or becoming thinner, whereas men and boys want to lose fat while gaining (muscular) weight; however actual behaviors are often similar between the two groups</li>
            <li>Men face many barriers with diagnosis and intervention. Until recently, the DSM criteria was designed for women. Interview questions to determine if a patient has an ED are often gender-specific (“I am satisfied with the size of my bust,” “I think my hips are too big”)</li>

        <h5>LGBTQ+ people</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Eating disorders among LGBTQ+ populations should be understood within the broader cultural context of oppression</li>
            <li>Unique social pressures facing LGBTQ+ youth may increase anxiety, depression, etc (comorbid with and contributing factors to EDs)</li>
            <li>Many healthcare providers are inadequately equipped to help LGBTQ+ clients</li>
            <li>Research is limited but it seems to show that rates of eating disorders among lesbians are consistent with rates among straight women, but rates among gay men are higher than rates among straight men</li>
            <li>In one study, a sense of connectedness to the gay community was related to fewer current eating disorders, which suggests that feeling connected to the gay community may have a protective effect against eating disorders</li>
            <li>Transgender people may experience particularly serious problems in finding an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment due to lack of awareness among medical professionals, co-occurrence of body dysmorphia, or other issues having to do with hormones, body image, and transition.</li>

        <h5>People of color</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Eating disorders affect people of all races and ethnicities, including people from black, latin@, Asian American, Native American, and immigrant communities.</li>
            <li>Many people of color struggle in identifying their eating disorder and finding proper treatment due to cultural perceptions that eating disorders do not happen in their communities, but the idea that any particular group is immune from eating disorders is a harmful myth.</li>
              <ul>
                <li><i>Cynthia Bulik, African American writer and ED activist:</i> “I have hesitated to come in because as a Black woman, I am supposed to be happy with my large body. Everyone says that we Black women are happy in our bodies no matter what the size. I wondered what was wrong with me, there wasn’t just something wrong with my eating, I wasn’t being a good enough Black woman because I didn’t like my body. Then I finally said, forget it, forget all these shoulds, something is wrong and I need help!”</li>
                <li><i>Rosie Molinary, Latina writer and body acceptance activist:</i> “Many Latinas report being caught between two standards of beauty leaving them either not feeling beautiful in either culture or feeling beautiful in one but not the other. They feel as if they are on the precipice of judgment caught between American pop culture and the values and cultural traditions of their family.”</li>
                <li><i>Margaret Cho, Asian-American comedian and writer:</i> “I have never been a heavy person, but for some reason, my physique drives some Korean people insane. They feel that I am too large for them to be comfortable, too large to be one of them. Any time I meet a Korean person, it is most likely that they will make one of the comments I have outlined. It is not a joke.”</li>

        <h5>In the Jewish community</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>EDs are on the rise in the Jewish community, but it is unclear why. Some possible explanations specific to Jewish culture include an emphasis on perfection or control and a preoccupation with food (ritual meals, food as social bonding, kashrut).</li>
            <li>Some have suggested that eating disorders are possibly a more culturally-accepted coping mechanism than other self-destructive behaviors, such as drug abuse.</li>

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <h5>Although negative body image is definitely correlated with eating disorders, problems with body image can NOT cause a person to "get" an eating disorder.</h5>
        <p>Unrealistic standards of “ideal bodies” might “kick off” an ED in some people, but in others the problems may have nothing to do with body dissatisfaction. Even in people who did start out struggling with body image, there is always much more to an eating disorder than the desire to fit into a certain image or ideal. Any individual might relate to food, size, weight, shape, routine, or rules in ways that are related to but not identical to or caused by media messages about "ideal" bodies.</p>
        <p>We cannot emphasize this enough. <b>EDs are not “about” body image and you cannot “cure” someone’s ED by convincing them that they are beautiful or that their body is acceptable.</b> We wish it were this simple, but the road to recovery is longer and more complex than just getting a self-esteem boost.</p>
